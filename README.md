You can run eSQ using ECJ (https://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/ ) via https://github.com/txt2vz/eSQ/blob/master/src/main/groovy/cluster/ClusterMainECJ.groovy 
Alternatively you can use the more modern Jenetics.IO ( https://jenetics.io/ ) via  https://github.com/txt2vz/eSQ/blob/master/src/main/groovy/cluster/JeneticsMain.java

We have found ECJ to produce slightly better results which we believe may be to do with the use of subpopulations
